## About Paladins Guru Scraper

WIP!

`Paladins Guru Scraper` is a personal project Python web scraper that pulls game statistics out of PaladinsGuru.com, performs data analyses, and exports it onto an interactive webpage.

This is based off of an old VBA/Excel version of the same project that I did for myself many years ago when I played the game.
